## What You Can Do
- Browse every EPUB in the current directory, drill into the table of contents, and resume exactly where you left off.
- Search inside the current chapter or across the whole book, jump through a per-book history, and inspect reading statistics.
- Highlight text, attach comments, copy snippets or entire chapters, and toggle the raw HTML source for debugging.
- Open images in-place, follow internal anchors, launch external links in your browser, and hand off the book to your system viewer.
- Customize with multiple color themes, adjustable margins, and zen mode; settings persist across sessions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Bookokrat requires a C compiler/linker to be installed on your system for building dependencies.

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

**Linux (Fedora/RHEL):**
```bash
sudo dnf install gcc make
```

**macOS:**
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Windows:**
Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

### Install Bookokrat

1. Install Rust via https://rustup.rs if needed.
2. Install bookokrat using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install bookokrat
```

3. Place EPUB files alongside the binary (or run within your library directory) and navigate with the shortcuts above.

### Troubleshooting

**Error: "linker 'cc' not found"**

This means you don't have a C compiler installed. Install the build tools for your platform (see Prerequisites above), then try again.
